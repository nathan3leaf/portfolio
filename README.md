The Powerpoint is a project I completed for my capstone and includes a variety of different charts, as well as the utilization of an ANOVA test. 
It is an example of exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and correlation discovery.

The Python files are for a simple Sudoku game I built using PyQt5 and my own algorithms to create the game boards.  You must download all three files - sudoku_mod.py, sudoku.ui and sudoku_ui.py.
Make sure all three files are in the same folder and run the sudoku_mod.py file to run the game. Choose your difficulty level by clicking on NEW GAME in the top
left corner of the screen. Even the hardest mode is not terribly hard. You can adjust the levels of difficulty in the sudoku_mod.py file. In the BuildUI __init_ method, adjust the difficulty
mode values - self.hard_mode for example.
